        <br>
        <p> Once one of the richest nations in Latin America, Venezuela now finds itself in one of the largest
            humanitarian and socioeconomic crisis in recent years. An estimated 5 million people have fled their
            homes and the 95% of the remaining Venezuelans are in abject poverty.
            It is often in times of greatest despair that the nobelest of human virtues
            manifest. Colombians have opened their borders and their homes to uplift millions of human lives from
            tragic suffering and worse.
            History bearing witness, this is not the first time the two nations have braved dire adversity. Be it their
            common struggle against the Spanish Colonists or the civil unrest in Colombia in the early-mid 2000s,
            the two nations have time and again unified as one and stood firm on their beliefs of humanity.

    <p>Prompted by civil strife and violence, Colombians have historically fled to Venezuela in search of a safer life
    and better quality of life. The number refugees from Colombia especially saw sudden surge in the mid-2000s, when the
    fossil-fuel rich Venezuela boasted a strong economy due to robust crude-oil prices. The Venezuelans were welcoming; the
    Chavez administration granted Colombians residency, the right to vote and other social benefits. The government
    even provided bus-services to Colombians, since a lot of families lived across borders.
    In recent years though, the flow of refugees has completely reversed. </p>

        Venezuelans in an extraordinarily short period of time, found the cash in their pockets amount to virtually
        nothing. With widespread famine and violent breakouts, 16% of Venezuelans have fled to several countries. With
        many countries closing their doors on these starving refugees families, Colombia has incredibily opened their
        borders and admitting an estimated 3500 refugees each day. Colombia presently hosts 30% of all Venezuelan refugees,
        with Peru being a distant second at around 20%.

            An interative plot that illustrates the ratio of Men and Women Venezuelan Refugees in Colombia. The Pie Chart gives
            a distribution of the refugees by age. It is evident that a more than half the the people affected are infact lesser 
            than the age of 30. This emphasises the impact of this humanatarial crisis on young, productive individuals. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The graph belows is an interative, modular Grouped/Stacked Bar Toggle chart which evidences the fraction of age groups affected by 
          this crisis in proportion to the total number of Venezualans overall. 
          That is, for each age-group considered, a ratio of refugees belonging to this age group and the number 
          of individuals in the overall Venezualan demographic is computed and plotted. This showcases fraction of age classes 
          and how heavily they are affected. Again it is infered that individuals below the age of 30 are severaly affected 
          by this crisis, and that it has affected men and women more-or-less equally.

          This phenomenal gesture of hopitality by the Colombians is not without sacrifice on their part. With over 3000
          refugees flowing into the country each day, the country's government agencies are hard-pressed for resources. With
          Venezuelans free to move around the country and permitted access to education, more refugees are moving towards urban
          areas. The population density of Bogota has sugerged as much as 3% in a the span of just over a year, putting enormous
          pressure on the public works in cities. The world must rally in support of Colombia and assist their efforts to manage

          <p> The Venezuelan Crisis has left a heavy toll on millions of lives

            events in Venezuela, but first we must extend our support to the people affected in any small way we can. Perhaps 
            this Visualization tool amounts to a very tiny effort towards this cause. The amount may be little, but our support is sincere.
