        <h1> Countries with a Shared History </h1>
        <br>
        <p> Once one of the richest nations in Latin America, Venezuela now finds itself in one of the largest 
            humanitarian and socioeconomic crisis in recent years. An estimated 5 million people have fled their 
            homes and the 95% of the remaining Venezuelans are in abject poverty. 
        </p>
        <p>
            It is often in times of greatest despair that the nobelest of human virtues
            manifest. Colombians have opened their borders and their homes to uplift millions of human lives from 
            tragic suffering and worse. 
        </p>
        </p>
            History bearing witness, this is not the first time the two nations have braved dire adversity. Be it their 
            common struggle against the Spanish Colonists or the civil unrest in Colombia in the early 2000s, 
            the two nations have time and again unified as one and stood firm on their beliefs of humanity.

    Since the 1970s, Colombians had fled to Venezuela to avoid violent conflict in their homeland. <br>
    In the 1990s, Colombians amounted to 77% of all immigrants in Venezuela, according to Raquel Alvarez, a sociologist at the Andes University in Venezuela. <br>
    With such programs, the Chávez administration then granted Colombians residency, the right to vote and other social services; even offering bus rides for Colombian-Venezuelans across the border who wanted to vote for Chávez.

        What are the major points of crossing. Port of entry. <br>
        But its not just the border towns where they live. <br>
        They are free to move in the country, have access to education and headed towards cities with economic opportunities. <br>
