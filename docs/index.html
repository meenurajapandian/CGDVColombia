        <br>
        <p> Once one of the richest nations in Latin America, Venezuela now finds itself in one of the largest
            humanitarian and socioeconomic crisis in recent years. An estimated 5 million people have fled their
            homes and the 95% of the remaining Venezuelans are in abject poverty.
            It is often in times of greatest despair that the nobelest of human virtues
            manifest. Colombians have opened their borders and their homes to uplift millions of human lives from
            tragic suffering and worse.
            History bearing witness, this is not the first time the two nations have braved dire adversity. Be it their
            common struggle against the Spanish Colonists or the civil unrest in Colombia in the early-mid 2000s,
            the two nations have time and again unified as one and stood firm on their beliefs of humanity.

    <!-- Since the 1970s, and especially in mid 2000s, Colombians have sort refuge in Venezuela. Fueled by
    a strong economy in Venezuela and civil unrest in Colombia, Colombians have historically
    fled to their neighbours in the north-east in hope for a safer life and better jobs. In the 90s, Colombians amounted to 77% of all
    refugees in Venezuela. The Chávez administration granted Colombians residency,
    the right to vote and other social benefits. The government even provided bus-services to
    Colombians, since a lot of families lived across borders.
    In recent years though, the flow of refugees has completely reversed. -->

    Prompted by civil strife and violence, Colombians have historically fled to Venezuela in search of a safer life
    and better quality of life. Number refugees from Colombia especially saw sudden surge in the mid-2000s, when the
    fuel-rich Venezuela boasted a strong economy due to robust crude-oil prices. The Venezuelans were welcoming; the
    Chávez administration granted Colombians residency, the right to vote and other social benefits. The government
    even provided bus-services to Colombians, since a lot of families lived across borders.
    In recent years though, the flow of refugees has completely reversed..

        Disaster struck in 2015. Global factors caused the crude-oil prices to crash and the one-industry economy
        of Venezuela was by-far the most affected. The government tried to cover the income gap by printing more notes,
        thus devaluing the currency, culminating in hyper-inflation. Now, bags and show-piece made out of the Bolivar are
        worth more than the currency's intrinsic value..

        Venezuelans in an extraordinarily short period of time, found the cash in their pockets amount to virtually
        nothing. With widespread famine and violent breakouts, 16% of Venezuelans have fled to several countries. With
        many countries closing their doors on these starving refugees families, Colombia has incredibily opened their
        borders and admitting an estimated 3500 refugees each day. Colombia presently hosts 30% of all Venezuelan refugees,
        with Peru being a distant second at around 20%.

          This phenomenal gesture of hopitality by the Colombians is not without sacrifice on their part. With over 3000
          refugees flowing into the country each day, the country's government agencies are hard-pressed for resources. With
          Venezuelans free to move around the country and permitted access to education, more refugees are moving towards urban
          areas. The population density of Bogota has sugerged as much as 3% in a the span of just over a year, putting enormous
          pressure on the public works in cities. The world must rally in support of Colombia and assist their efforts to manage
          this unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
