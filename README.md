Venezuelan migration crisis in Columbia

### Goals
Viz should be insightful and useful to USAID Columbia
Uncover a story in the data” not just visualize the data. 
How do we better understand the challenges and impact of Venezuelan migration into Colombia; and how do we use that information to better the lives of the communities hosting these migrants, and the migrants themselves?
